As of 2022, the government of India decided to launch its own CBDC.
Central Bank Digital Currency AKA Digital Rupee


### Where does CBDC fit in the entire monetory system?

Money can be divided into 2 aspects: 
1) Physical 
2) Digital

	- Physical money therein consist of white and black money.
	- Digital money consist of:
		- Bank A/C money
		- CBDC
		- Representation of money (amazon pay wallet, paytm wallet, etc)
		- Enablers (UPI)
			- Note to self: UPI is not digital money, it is an enabler of digital payments.

92% of money is digital and only 8% of it is hard cash


### Who controls these numbers?

Payment and settlement system is controlled in India by RBI( Reserve Bank of India)
	- They are controlling something called ledgers.
	- There is obviously a master ledger that accounts for all the digital transaction
	- Now these commercial banks (ICICI, AXIS, SBI) have their own type of ledgers too.
	- All these are connected to this master ledger which in turn allows RBI monitor how much money is flowing thorugh the economy

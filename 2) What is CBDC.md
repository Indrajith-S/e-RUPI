CBDC is not a new currency but an electronic version of the existing rupee
so then the question arises..

### how is this money any different from digital money?

CBDC may be maintained in a conventional Centrally Controlled database or a ditributed ledger technology like blockchain.

- What is blockchain?
	- In simple terms blockchain is a technology that enables one builds a network that allows to push or transfer data from point A to B.
	- CBDC is said to being build in blockchain
	- Blockchain users are identified by addresses (public keys), which cannot be easily linked back to them without out-of-network information. This provides pseudo anonymity, which is amplified when the user generates a new address for each transaction.

- What is Centralized ledger?
	- A master ledger controlled and maintained by RBI where children ledgers or commercial banks' ledgers are accounted for.
	- Some party is always accountable for all ledgers.

- What is Distributed ledger?
	- This kind of ledger is maintained and controlled by something called a smart contract which is a self executing code.
	- For example, if RBI decided to share the master ledger over the internet, then people like you and I can access these master ledgers and every transaction ever made will be visible to us.
	- Another example where Etherium is a distributed ledger, by visiting Etherscan one can see all the latest transactions happening on Etherium.

!! As no such system (DLT) exists in India, hence CBDC will also be a centralized ledger.
